      "Realistically, the share price should be in the $800 range, and should have been coming out of earnings. The run to the $1200s was a gamma squeeze triggered by that Hertz announcement. No technical support for it. Where we are now is not a dip. It’s the unwinding of shares purchased to hedge that’s pushing it down. When we get back to $800s, expected. If we get to $700s, dip and incredible buying opportunity. Sustained growth requires some pullback, support, resistance, and testing both. Elon selling stock is a distraction. He owns ~20% of Tesla. Selling 10% of that is 2%, which gets swallowed up by regular trading volume. Keep buying, be patient, we’ll eventually get back over $1200 with proper support. Might take a few years.\n",

      "The comment: MUSK sells promises (memes) primarily, and products, secondarily.  TSLA sells EVs but what does SpaceX, Boring Co., Neuralink, Skylink, etc sell?  Promises, but not even that, just ideas of uncertain utility and unclear profitability.  He even jumped into crypto with Dogecoin.   One of these ideas or memes may prove profitable, but highly unlikely for the retail investor to win with any one memes of his.  TSLA is an interesting idea, but not practical for long range driving, especially when factoring in the safety issue of evacuating from foci of natural or man made disasters.\n",
